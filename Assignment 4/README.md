# Assignment 4: Implement the construction of a VP Tree and perform All-kNN search on the tree using CUDA

## Description

This assignment targets the optimization of the construction of a VP Tree data structure with the use of CUDA, as well as the performance of an All-kNN search on the points of the tree.

You can try adjusting the size of input to check the difference in execution time between the implementations. You can read more about Vantage Point Trees and its usages here: https://fribbels.github.io/vptree/writeup

## Usage

This project makes use of CUDA programming. Make sure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU in your computer and the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit installed.

You can then compile the CUDA files with `nvcc main.cu` and run them as usual at a Linux terminal.
